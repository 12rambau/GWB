Because forest fragmentation is scale-dependent, fragmentation is reported at five observation scales, which allows different observers to make their own choice about scales and threshold of concern. The change of fragmentation across different observation scales provides additional interesting information. Fragmentation is measured by determining the Forest Area Density (FAD) within a shifting, local neighborhood. It can be measured at pixel or patch level. The result are spatially explicit maps and tabular summary statistics. Details on the methodology and input/output options can be found in the [Fragmentation](https://ies-ows.jrc.ec.europa.eu/gtb/GTB/psheets/GTB-Fragmentation-FADFOS.pdf) product sheet.",
